I think I figured out how we can handle the scope issues. Where it would take way to long to process anything across the whole continent if we had any detail.

I don't know if you ever played Sim City 4, but in it they had a large scale map which you chose a "region" to progress a city in.
The regions could trade with one another and I'm sure on save and exit from them they generated a static image for the large scale map to show.
What we could do is follow that pattern. Initially fill the large scale map with the base attributes. Then the user has the option to advance time in a "region". That region is a managable computation chunck, and the incentive to advance the whole map and not just one region would be that you could only "export" to other regions if there was a demand and transport method between the large scale "Regions".


Good Idea or Bad?
